# Ecommerce Admin Dashboard

This is the frontend of my Ecommerce app  build with Next.js and Shadcn.

Practiced using Shadcn components, added interactive charts, a sidebar, changed theme colors. Added a separate page for tracking all orders and a user page.

The orders page contains pagination, as well as the ability to change the number of items to display.

The user page has chart components, card components, and other components for displaying information. There is a user edit button that moves to the right, used React-hook-form for the form and Zod for validation.
